Binary trees
root

Branches

level 0,1,2,3,4,...., n
maximum nodes can be possible at a level (2**n)


Binary tree any binary tree
********maximum number of nodes of height n = 2**(n+1)-1  this leads to calculate the minimum height using n nodes
********minimum number of nodes of height n = n+1  this lead to calculate the maximum number of height using n nodes


full binary tree - every node containing 2 childs or no child except leaf nodes
******In a full binary tree number of leaf nodes = no of internal nodes + 1
******In a full binary tree minimum number of 


complete binary trees
Every node is filled form left to right
****maximum no. of nodes - 2**(n+1)  - 1
****minimum no. of nodes - 2**n

****minimum height - [log2(n+1)]-1
****maximum height - [log2(n)]



perfect binary tree
every leaf are on the same lavel and all the internal nodes are having two childs.
**** 


degenerate binary tree
all the internal nodes are having one child
left skewed binary tree - every child is on left side
right skewed binary tree - every child is on the right side

Binary search tree
